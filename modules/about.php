	<h2>Friendship!</h2>
	<p>
		Through participation in our programs, you will have the opportunity of developing friendships with Canadians and also with other international students like yourself.  Though you may be far from your own family while at university, you can make friends and perhaps enjoy your time even more while you are here.
